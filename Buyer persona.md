# Buyer persona

A buyer persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer based on market research and real data about your existing customers.

Buyer personas provide structure and context for your company, making it easier to map out content, allocate your team’s time and resources, and achieve alignment across your organization.

## How should I use a Persona?

Learning about your ideal customer —their challenges, their goals, their demographic traits, and so on —helps you set a strategy aimed at attracting the most valuable visitors, leads, and customers to your business.

## How well do you really know your ideal customers?

How well do you know their goals, backgrounds, and their challenges? How well do you understand their interests and needs? Do you know how old they are? Where they went to school? Kids? A day in their life looks like?

**CREATING VERY SPECIFIC BUYER PERSONAS CAN DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE YOUR BUSINESS RESULTS**

## Buyer Persona

The strongest buyer personas are based on market research as well as on insights you gather from your actual customer base — through surveys, interviews, and so on.

## How to Research Buyer Personas

- Interview customers: ask a question about their job role and title, what a typical day-in-the life looks like, what tools they use in their job, what are their challenges, how they learn, where are they from, how they search information
- Look for behavioral trends
- Optimize forms for your persona
- Talk to the sales team

Tips

- Use incentives
- Be clear this isn´t a sales call
- Make it easy to say yes.**Take care of everything for your potential interviewee. Sugest times, but be flexible; allow them to pick a time right of the bat, and send a calendar invitation with a reminder to block off their time.**
